# RPG Dragon Game

Welcome to the RPG Dragon Game project! This project is part of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum and is designed to help you learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Role Playing Game.

In this project, I worked with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: HTML file for the game interface.
- **style.css**: CSS file for styling the game interface.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## Getting Started

To get started playing the RPG Dragon Game:

1. Access the [RPG Dragon Game](https://rpg-dragon-game.vercel.app/) website.
2. Decide where you want to go first and learn what happens.
3. Have fun exploring different scenarios, making decisions, and progressing through the game!

Use your JavaScript programming skills to modify the game and make it even more exciting!
